It prevents a lot of requests from reaching networks like Google Hosted Libraries, and serves local files to keep sites from breaking. Complements regular content blockers.","fullDescription":"Websites have increasingly begun to rely much more on large third-parties for content delivery. Canceling requests for ads or trackers is usually without issue, however blocking actual content, not unexpectedly, breaks pages. The aim of this add-on is to cut out the middleman by providing lightning speed delivery of local (bundled) files to improve online privacy.\n\n     • Protects privacy by evading large delivery networks that claim to offer free services.\n     • Complements regular blockers such as uBlock Origin (recommended), Adblock Plus, et al.\n     • Works directly out of the box; absolutely no prior configuration required.\n\nNote: Decentraleyes is no silver bullet, but it does prevent a lot of websites from making you send these kinds of requests. Ultimately, you can make Decentraleyes block requests for any missing CDN resources, too.\n\n   > Simpler introduction: https://git.synz.io/Synzvato/decentraleyes/wikis/Simple-Introduction\n\nAm I Currently Protected?\n\nThe following testing utility shows you if you are properly protected.
